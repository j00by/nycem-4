## Project Overview

Climate gentrification refers to the process where changes in the environment, particularly those due to climate change such as rising sea levels and increased frequency of extreme weather events, begin to affect urban real estate patterns and social demographics. This project uses the Mapbox Storytelling Template to create an engaging and educational experience that illustrates how these dynamics are playing out in New York City.

## Features

- **Interactive Maps:** Utilize Mapbox GL JS to showcase dynamic mapping of flood risks, housing data, and demographic shifts.
- **Data-Driven Storytelling:** Narratives built around data from various authoritative sources provide insights into how climate change impacts urban living spaces.
- **Visualization of Trends:** Trends in property values, demographic changes, and urban planning are visualized over time to highlight the areas most affected by climate gentrification.
