# Climate Gentrification and Its Impact on New York City

This project is developed as part of the John D Solomon Fellowship for Public Service and in collaboration with New York City Emergency Management. Its goal is to look into and show how climate gentrification affects different New York City neighborhoods by using interactive web mapping and the technical skills I learned in Chris Whong's Advanced GIS class at NYU.

## Research Questions

1) How does climate gentrification, characterized by environmental changes such as rising sea levels and increased frequency of extreme weather events, influence urban real estate patterns and social demographics in New York City?

2) How can this research be illustrated through the Mapbox Storytelling Template?

## Features

- **Interactive Maps:** Utilize Mapbox GL JS to showcase dynamic mapping of flood risks, housing data, and demographic shifts.
- **Data-Driven Storytelling:** Narratives built around data from various authoritative sources provide insights into how climate change impacts urban living spaces.
- **Visualization of Trends:** Trends in property values, demographic changes, and urban planning are visualized over time to highlight the areas most affected by climate gentrification.
